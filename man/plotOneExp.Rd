\usage{
plotOneExp(fitRes, ind2plot = NA, cols = NA, type = "plot",
  style = "full", h = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.7), tag = NA, main = NA,
  cex.main = 1, xlab = NA, ylab = NA, ylim = NA, xlim = NA,

  showTopN = NA, lwd = 2, cex.axis = 1, cex.lab = 1,
  addOutlierLegend = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitRes}{return value from fitOneExp()}

\item{ind2plot}{index for the models that will be plotted; default is NA which leads to all curves available; when specified as 'best', the best model is selected}

\item{cols}{color for the lines. If cols is of length 1, then all lines (representing different models) have the same color as specified; if cols has a length larger than 1,
the function further checks if this length equals the number of fitted models. If this is the case, cols specifies colors for all models. Otherwise, default color is used.}

\item{type}{either plot or line; when specified as line, it will only adds to an existing figure; When length(ind2plot)>1, type will be reset to plot
which means the first curve will be made with plot() and additional ones with lines()}

\item{style}{if style == 'full', the outlier status as well as its legend will be shown; if style=='simple', the points and legend
for outlier status will be removed; if style=='points', only points will be shown; this is useful if to compare multiple curves from different drugs.}

\item{h}{horizontal line added to the figure, i.e. indicating IC50, IC70}

\item{tag}{tag before main}

\item{main}{main}

\item{cex.main}{cex.main to adjust main title size}

\item{xlab}{xlab}

\item{ylab}{ylab}

\item{ylim}{ylim}

\item{xlim}{xlim}

\item{show}{whether to show RSE ('RSE'), IC50 ('IC50'), both ('both') or nothing ('None') in addition to the best model as legend}

\item{cexLegend}{legend cex}

\item{posLegend}{position of legend for model information}

\item{showTopN}{if specified show best N model in figure to avoid busy plotting; otherwise show all successful models.}

\item{lwd}{line width for the curves}

\item{cex.axis}{cex for axis annotation}

\item{cex.lab}{cex for axis label}

\item{addOutlierLegend}{whether to add legend for outlier status}

\item{cex.main}{cex for main title}
